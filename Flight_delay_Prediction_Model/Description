Nowadays, the aviation industry plays a crucial role in the world's transportation sector, and a lot of businesses rely on various airlines to connect them with other parts of the world. But, extreme weather conditions may directly affect the airline services by means of flight delays.

To solve this issue, accurately predicting these flight delays allows passengers to be well prepared for the deterrent caused to their journey and enables airlines to respond to the potential causes of the flight delays in advance to diminish the negative impact.

The purpose of this project is to look at the approaches used to build models for predicting flight delays that occur due to bad weather conditions.
